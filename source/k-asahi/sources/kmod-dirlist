# File....: slackwareaarch64-<ver>/source/k/sources/kmod-dirlist
# Purpose : Collect the base directories and specific Linux Kernel Modules integrated into
#           the Slackware OS InitRD and Installer.
############################################################################################
# List is produced by running '../scripts/list_loaded_kmod_dirs' on each supported
# Hardware Model within the Slackware OS.
#
# The list undergoes filtering in the build process via '../scripts/slim-kmods-initrd',
# distinguishing between constructing the OS InitRD and assembling the Installer.
#
# The reasoning behind this methodology is to encompass a broad range of common subsystems
# found across various Hardware Models (such as USB, Ethernet, PCI). Subsequently, we refine
# this selection by eliminating specific components unnecessary for booting the OS
# (in the OS InitRD context) or installing Slackware (pertaining to the Installer).
# Both the Installer and OS InitRD are designed as versatile, generic environments. As a
# result, they are engineered to accommodate a wider spectrum of hardware, necessitating
# a more comprehensive inclusion of components compared to tailored setups for specific
# Hardware Models.
#
# These paths are relative to: /lib/modules/<kernel_version>-<arch>/kernel/
# The 'tar' command processes this list using the '--wildcards' option, allowing you to
# leverage its functionality.
