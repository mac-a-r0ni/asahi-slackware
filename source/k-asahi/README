k-asahi
-------

This is an edited "k-wip" package script from slackwareaarch64,
I've basically just hacked it until it made the packages I was
after. It is by no means perfect, nor easy to work with.

Eventually, I'd like to replace this with a custom script to 
build what we need, removing all we don't.

For now this works, to build, get the latest asahi kernel source
tarball, place it in source/ and run the ARM build script from the 
root k-asahi dir, like so "./arm/build". This will create
separate packages for the kernel, modules, headers, and a source
package.

The default config contained here is from the alpine linux 
asahi support git server, and in no way resembles a default
slackware kernel (but we aren't on default hardware, are we?)

Have fun.
