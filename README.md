# asahi-slackware
SlackBuilds to enable Slackware ARM (aarch64) to run on Apple Silicon (ports of Asahi Linux).

Official (upstream): https://github.com/AsahiLinux/PKGBUILDs Asahi Linux officially ships with Arch Linux underneath, these scripts are meant to provide support for Asahi to run on top of Slackware instead.

This repo is WIP as is slackwareaarch64-current. There is currently no stable release of the OS to build from and no installer included.

This is for public backup of the work I'm attempting to complete. Patches are welcomed for missing/incomplete software.

I personally know next to nothing of how these machines boot, much less the ARM platform. If there's a real developer with an interest in seeing Slackware run on Asahi, I'd be forever grateful for any help one would give.
