libunwind: libunwind (API to determine the call-chain of a program)
libunwind:
libunwind: The primary goal of libunwind is to define a portable and efficient C
libunwind: programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program.
libunwind: The API additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved
libunwind: (callee-saved) state of each call-frame and to resume execution at
libunwind: any point in the call-chain (non-local goto). Some uses for this API
libunwind: include exception handling, debuggers, introspection, or implementing
libunwind: an extremely efficient version of setjmp().
